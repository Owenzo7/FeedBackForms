# Summary.

The Mystic Finance making a environment dedicated to RWA-backed lending which takes RWA's different characteristics into account and not only supports them, but leverages them to their full potential.

### Findings.

### [H-1]("https://cantina.xyz/code/c160af78-28f8-47f7-9926-889b3864c6d8/findings/679") Missing access control in `stPlumeMinter::restake()` allows unauthorized fund restaking.

The `stPlumeMinter::restake()` lacks proper access control, allowing any external user to `restake` funds from cooling/parked pools to any validator. This operation should be restricted to accounts with the `REBALANCER_ROLE`.

```solidity
@>  function restake(uint16 validatorId) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 amountRestaked) { 
        _rebalance();
        (PlumeStakingStorage.StakeInfo memory info) = plumeStaking.stakeInfo(address(this));
        amountRestaked = plumeStaking.restake(validatorId, info.cooled + info.parked);
        
        emit Restaked(address(this), validatorId, amountRestaked);
        return amountRestaked;
    }
```

* Always make sure there is access control in the restake function.
  
### [H-2]("https://cantina.xyz/code/c160af78-28f8-47f7-9926-889b3864c6d8/findings/635") Unstaking extends the cooldown period for all queued withdrawals, causing DoS.

Users can withdraw funds by `unstaking` first then proceeding to call withdraw() once `cooldown` period has passed.

After unstaking, their funds are stored as `"parked"` (funds that have cooled and now can be withdrawn) and `"cooled"` (funds that have yet to be cooled down).

As `cooldown` period comes to an end, these funds convert from `"cooled"` to `"parked"`.

The problem is that any further unstaking call will extend the `cooldown` period:

```solidity
// 3. Set/Reset the cooldown timer for the current cooled balance
        globalInfo.cooldownEnd = block.timestamp + $.cooldownInterval;
```

So if this period is increased, the user who had queued for withdrawal previously has to now wait a longer period:

```solidity
function withdraw() external nonReentrant returns (uint256 amount) {
        PlumeStakingStorage.Layout storage $ = _getPlumeStorage();
        PlumeStakingStorage.StakeInfo storage info = $.stakeInfo[msg.sender];

        amount = info.parked;
@>      if (info.cooled > 0 && info.cooldownEnd <= block.timestamp) {
            uint256 cooledAmount = info.cooled; // Store before zeroing
            amount += cooledAmount;
            info.cooled = 0;

            // Need to adjust totalCooling if it exists and is accurate
            if ($.totalCooling >= cooledAmount) {
                $.totalCooling -= cooledAmount;
            } else {
                $.totalCooling = 0; // Avoid underflow
            }
            // Reset cooldown end time only if cooled amount becomes zero
            if (info.cooled == 0) {
                info.cooldownEnd = 0;
            }
        }
```

Therefore any `unstaking` calls that occur before the cooldown period ends, will continue to indefinitely `extend` the time period where users can actually withdraw their funds.

* Didn't really know that this is a bug.

## Take aways.

* Where the cooldown period has been `set`, always try and see whether it can be extended through `reentering` that same function that sets it if another function requires the current time to have surpassed the `cooldown` period in order to execute.


### [H-3]("https://cantina.xyz/code/c160af78-28f8-47f7-9926-889b3864c6d8/findings/406") `stPlumeMinter::withdraw()` disregards currentWithheldETH when `amount > currentWithheldETH`, leading to incorrect fund accounting.

The `withdraw()` method in the `stPlumeMinter` contract is responsible for allowing users to withdraw their previously unstaked native tokens. However, thereâ€™s a critical vulnerability in the logic used to manage `currentWithheldETH`. Specifically, when `amount > currentWithheldETH`, the contract calls `plumeStaking.withdraw()` to withdraw all unstaked tokens, but it resets currentWithheldETH to 0 without actually utilizing its value.

High-Impact Scenario:

1. currentWithheldETH = `0.01 Ether`
2. Alice `unstake()` 1 Ether and withdraw().
3. plumeStaking returns `1.09 Ether`. `1 Ether` is sent to Alice and currentWithheldETH = `0.09 Ether`.
4. Bob unstake() 10 Ether and withdraw().
5. plumeStaking returns 11 Ether. `10 Ether` is sent to Bob and currentWithheldETH = `1 Ether`.

This results in the protocol losing accounting.

```solidity
        if(amount > currentWithheldETH ){
            withdrawn = plumeStaking.withdraw();
@>            currentWithheldETH = 0;
        } else {
            withdrawn = amount;
            currentWithheldETH -= amount;
        }

```

When withdrawing, and `amount > witheldAmount`, make sure to check that the `withHeldAmount` is not being reset to zero but instead used to account towards the withdrawn amount.

### [H-4]("https://cantina.xyz/code/c160af78-28f8-47f7-9926-889b3864c6d8/findings/200") Staking of protocol fee funds (`withHoldEth`) leading to revenue loss.

The `stPlumeMinter` contains a bug that causes protocol fees `(tracked in withHoldEth)` to be unintentionally staked along with user funds. This occurs because the `_rebalance()` function calls depositEther(address(this).balance), which sends all available ETH to the staking contract regardless of whether some portion is reserved for protocol fees.

When `withdrawFee()` is later called to transfer accumulated fees to the protocol owner, the contract attempts to send the full `withHoldEth` amount using a low-level call. Since these fees have already been staked, the transfer will either fail completely or transfer an amount less than expected. The contract then unconditionally resets `withHoldEth` to 0, effectively "forgetting" about the fees that were not successfully transferred.

## What went wrong and how to fix it next time.

* Didn't really think about this.

## Take aways.

During `rebalancing` when ether is being sent to the staking contract make sure that the `withHeldEth` is not part of that amount because they would be problems in the `withdrawFee` function, when trying to withdraw the `withHeldEth` since there is non available.
